# create-untitled-app

My personal template for creating SvelteKit apps.

# Getting started

```
npx create-untitled-app@latest
```

or

```
npm create untitled-app@latest
```

If no name is specified, you'll be asked for one after running the command.

# Purpose

The template's purpose is to deliver a (cue the buzz-words) typesafe, modern and feature-rich SvelteKit experience.

# Includes

- [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/)  
    - [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)  
        - (I use [svelte-add](https://github.com/svelte-add)'s [tailwindcss](https://github.com/svelte-add/tailwindcss) to add them both, props to them, speeds up the process!)
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)

# Why is it untitled?

Can't think of a name right now.

# Inspried by

create-react-app, create-t3-app and other templates
